# CI/CD Test Fix ✅

## Problem
The CI/CD pipeline was failing with this error:
```
No tests found, exiting with code 1
```

## Root Cause
- We created the project structure in Step 0
- No test files were written yet (tests come in later steps)
- Jest (the test runner) was configured to **fail** when no tests are found
- This caused the CI/CD pipeline to fail

## Solution Applied

### 1. **API (NestJS)** - Added `--passWithNoTests` flag
```json
{
  "test": "jest --passWithNoTests",
  "test:cov": "jest --coverage --passWithNoTests"
}
```

This tells Jest to pass (exit code 0) even when no test files exist.

### 2. **Web (Next.js)** - Added placeholder test script
```json
{
  "test": "echo \"No tests yet\" && exit 0"
}
```

### 3. **Types Package** - Added placeholder test script
```json
{
  "test": "echo \"No tests yet\" && exit 0"
}
```

## Verification

Running `pnpm test` now shows:
```
✓ types:test - "No tests yet" 
✓ api:test - No tests found, exiting with code 0
✓ web:test - "No tests yet"

Tasks:    4 successful, 4 total
```

## When to Add Real Tests

Tests will be added in later steps:
- **Step 1**: Database and Redis integration tests
- **Step 2**: Component and E2E tests
- **Step 3**: Payment and webhook tests
- **Step 4**: Performance tests

For now, this allows CI/CD to pass during the bootstrapping phase.

## Status
✅ **CI/CD is now working** - Ready to push to GitHub!
