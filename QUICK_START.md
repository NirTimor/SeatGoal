# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- pnpm installed globally (already done!)

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Run Development Servers
```bash
# Start all services
pnpm dev
```

This will start:
- **Frontend** (Next.js): http://localhost:3000
- **API** (NestJS): http://localhost:3001

### 3. Test the Application

#### Frontend:
- Visit http://localhost:3000
- You'll be redirected to http://localhost:3000/he (Hebrew - default)
- Click the language switcher to switch to English
- See the homepage with RTL support for Hebrew

#### API:
- Visit http://localhost:3001/health
- Should return: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","service":"SeatGoal API"}`

#### Available API endpoints:
- GET /health
- GET /events
- GET /seats
- POST /cart/hold
- POST /checkout/session
- POST /webhooks/payment

(Note: Endpoints return placeholder responses until Step 1 is complete)

## Building for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will:
1. Build the types package
2. Build the API
3. Build the Next.js frontend (static pages)

## Running Individual Apps

```bash
# Frontend only
pnpm --filter web dev

# API only
pnpm --filter api dev

# Types only (watch mode)
pnpm --filter types dev
```

## Project Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm dev` | Start all apps in development mode |
| `pnpm build` | Build all apps |
| `pnpm lint` | Lint all apps |
| `pnpm test` | Run tests (when implemented) |
| `pnpm clean` | Clean build artifacts |

## Language Support

The app supports:
- **Hebrew (×¢×‘×¨×™×ª)** - Default, with RTL support
- **English** - LTR layout

Switch languages using the language switcher in the top navigation.

## What's Working

âœ… Monorepo structure with Turborepo
âœ… Next.js frontend with i18n
âœ… NestJS backend with module structure
âœ… Shared types with Zod validation
âœ… Development workflow
âœ… Build process
âœ… CI/CD configuration

## What's Next (Step 1)

- Database setup (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
- Redis for seat holds
- Authentication
- Real API endpoints with data

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use
If ports 3000 or 3001 are in use, you'll need to stop those services or change the ports in the configuration.

### Build errors
Make sure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Types not found
Build the types package first:
```bash
pnpm --filter types build
```
