# Checkout Flow Implementation - Complete

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Phase 2.4 & Phase 3.2 Complete

---

## What Was Implemented

### Backend (NestJS)

#### 1. Checkout Service (`apps/api/src/checkout/checkout.service.ts`)
✅ Complete implementation with 3 main methods:

**`createSession()`**
- Validates user input (email, name, phone)
- Retrieves held seats from Redis
- Verifies event exists and is on sale
- Gets ticket inventory for held seats
- Calculates total amount
- Creates order in database (PENDING status)
- Creates order items (junction with ticket inventory)
- Generates payment session ID
- Stores session in Redis (5-minute expiry)
- Returns checkout URL and order details

**`getOrderStatus()`**
- Retrieves order by ID with full details
- Returns order, event, stadium, items, customer info
- Used for order confirmation pages

**`simulatePayment()`**
- Simulates payment success/failure (MVP)
- On success:
  - Updates order to PAID
  - Updates ticket inventory to SOLD
  - Releases Redis holds
  - Deletes payment session
- On failure:
  - Updates order to CANCELLED
  - Releases seats to AVAILABLE
  - Releases Redis holds
  - Deletes payment session

#### 2. Checkout Controller (`apps/api/src/checkout/checkout.controller.ts`)
✅ Three endpoints:

- `POST /checkout/session` (protected) - Create checkout session
- `GET /checkout/order/:orderId` (protected) - Get order status
- `POST /checkout/simulate-payment` (public) - Simulate payment for MVP

---

### Frontend (Next.js)

#### 1. API Client Updates (`apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`)
✅ Added three new methods:

- `createCheckoutSession()` - Creates order and checkout session
- `getOrderStatus()` - Retrieves order details
- `simulatePayment()` - Simulates payment (MVP)

#### 2. Checkout Page (`apps/web/src/app/[locale]/checkout/page.tsx`)
✅ Main checkout entry point:
- Receives `eventId` and `sessionId` from URL params
- Validates parameters
- Renders CheckoutForm component

#### 3. Checkout Form Component (`apps/web/src/components/CheckoutForm.tsx`)
✅ Complete form for customer details:
- Pre-fills email, first name, last name from Clerk user
- Phone number input
- Form validation
- Calls `createCheckoutSession()` API
- Redirects to payment simulation
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Bilingual (Hebrew/English)

#### 4. Payment Simulation Page (`apps/web/src/app/[locale]/checkout/payment/page.tsx`)
✅ Payment simulation entry point:
- Receives `session` and `order` from URL params
- Validates parameters
- Renders PaymentSimulation component

#### 5. Payment Simulation Component (`apps/web/src/components/PaymentSimulation.tsx`)
✅ MVP payment simulator:
- Two buttons: "Successful Payment" / "Failed Payment"
- Calls `simulatePayment()` API with success flag
- Redirects to success or failure page
- Bilingual UI
- Warning note about MVP simulation

#### 6. Success Page (`apps/web/src/app/[locale]/checkout/success/page.tsx`)
✅ Order confirmation page:
- Success icon and message
- Order ID display
- Links to browse more events
- Link to home page
- Bilingual

#### 7. Failure Page (`apps/web/src/app/[locale]/checkout/failure/page.tsx`)
✅ Payment failure page:
- Failure icon and message
- Order ID display
- Explanation that seats were released
- Option to try again
- Links back to events
- Bilingual

#### 8. Updated Event Details (`apps/web/src/components/EventDetails.tsx`)
✅ Modified "Proceed to Checkout" button:
- Changed from button to link
- Links to `/checkout?event={eventId}&session={sessionId}`
- Only shows when seats are held

---

## Complete User Flow

### 1. Browse Events
```
User visits /events → Sees list of available events
```

### 2. Select Event
```
User clicks event → /events/{id} → Sees seat map
```

### 3. Select Seats
```
User selects seats (max 10) → Clicks "Hold Seats"
```

### 4. Seats Held
```
Backend creates Redis holds (10 min) → Returns hold expiry
Frontend shows countdown timer → "Proceed to Checkout" button appears
```

### 5. Checkout Form
```
User clicks "Proceed to Checkout" → /checkout?event=X&session=Y
Pre-filled form with user details → User enters phone
User clicks "Continue to Payment"
```

### 6. Create Order
```
Backend:
- Validates held seats
- Creates order (PENDING)
- Creates order items
- Generates payment session
- Returns checkout URL

Frontend redirects to payment page
```

### 7. Payment Simulation (MVP)
```
/checkout/payment?session=X&order=Y
User sees two buttons:
- Successful Payment (green)
- Failed Payment (red)
```

### 8a. Success Flow
```
User clicks "Successful Payment"
Backend:
- Updates order to PAID
- Updates tickets to SOLD
- Releases Redis holds
Frontend redirects to /checkout/success
Shows confirmation with order ID
```

### 8b. Failure Flow
```
User clicks "Failed Payment"
Backend:
- Updates order to CANCELLED
- Releases seats to AVAILABLE
- Releases Redis holds
Frontend redirects to /checkout/failure
Shows failure message
```

## Database Changes

### Orders Created
When user proceeds to checkout:
```sql
INSERT INTO orders (
  user_id, event_id, total_amount, currency,
  status, email, first_name, last_name, phone
) VALUES (...);
```

### Order Items Created
```sql
INSERT INTO order_items (
  order_id, ticket_inventory_id, price
) VALUES (...);
```

### On Payment Success
```sql
UPDATE orders SET status = 'PAID', payment_intent_id = '...' WHERE id = '...';
UPDATE ticket_inventory SET status = 'SOLD', hold_expires_at = NULL WHERE id IN (...);
```

### On Payment Failure
```sql
UPDATE orders SET status = 'CANCELLED' WHERE id = '...';
UPDATE ticket_inventory SET status = 'AVAILABLE', hold_expires_at = NULL WHERE id IN (...);
```

cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Click "View Events" (צפה באירועים)
3. Click on any event
4. Sign in with Clerk
5. Select 2-3 seats (click green seats)
6. Click "Hold Seats" (החזק מושבים)
7. Wait for confirmation and timer
8. Click "Proceed to Checkout" (המשך לתשלום)

12. See success page with order confirmation

### 2. Failure Flow Test
Repeat steps 1-10, but click "Failed Payment" (red button) instead

### 3. Verify Database
```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm prisma studio
```

Check:
- Orders table has new records
- OrderItems table has ticket details
- TicketInventory shows SOLD status for purchased seats

## Production Notes

### What Needs to Change for Production

**Replace Payment Simulation:**
1. Remove `simulatePayment()` endpoint
2. Integrate real payment provider (Stripe/PayPal):
   ```typescript
   // Example with Stripe
   const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
     payment_method_types: ['card'],
     line_items: [...],
     mode: 'payment',
     success_url: `${FRONTEND_URL}/checkout/success?order={orderId}`,
     cancel_url: `${FRONTEND_URL}/checkout/failure?order={orderId}`,
   });

   return { checkoutUrl: session.url };
   ```
3. Implement real webhook handler for payment confirmation
4. Add webhook signature verification
5. Remove PaymentSimulation component
6. Redirect directly to payment provider URL

**Security Enhancements:**
- Add rate limiting on checkout endpoint
- Implement fraud detection
- Add 3D Secure support
- Log all payment attempts
- Add payment retry logic
- Implement refund handling
